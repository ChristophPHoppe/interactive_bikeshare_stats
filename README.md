# Interactive BikeShare Statistics

### **Description**

This project was created within the scope of the Data Science Nanodegree program from Udacity. The project analyses data of a bikeshare company using individual user input. The user is able to decide on the city - either New York City, Chicago or Washington - and on the time scope, whether monthly or daily data should be evaluated.

### **Files used**

* Pandas is used to compute descriptive statistics. 

* CSV data sets for the different cities and customer was provided by Udacity.

### **Credits**

The main function to execute the code was provided by Udacity. Each of the other functions were constructed by me.
